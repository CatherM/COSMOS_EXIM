# COSMOS_EXIM

This repository is made as a back-up and version control for a research project at the Amsterdam UMC, location AMC Experimental Immunology-Hematology department. This project will utilize Saezlab's method COSMOS for regulatory network generation through the integration of multi-omic data. In this research, we applied the COSMOS method to gene expression and metabolomics datasets of CLL and healthy donor T cells.

## Pipeline explanation

We created the following 7-step pipeline, each step corresponding to a script, which can be found under [`scripts`](https://github.com/CatherM/COSMOS_EXIM/tree/main/scripts). This pipeline shows each step of the network generation workflow, from raw data to network visualization in Cytoscape.

The input is from unpublished sources, which can be requested via f.s.peters\@amsterdamumc.nl.

## Output

The networks can be found under `network_figures/individual` and `network_figures/merged`.

The thesis resulting from this research project can be found in this repository as `Thesis.pdf`.

## Requirements

IBM Cplex was used used as the ILP solver for COSMOS in this project. This was a requirement for this version of COSMOS. IBM provides CPLEX Optimization Studio freely under an academic license.
