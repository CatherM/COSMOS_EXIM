# COSMOS_EXIM

This repository is made as a back-up and version control for a research project at the Amsterdam UMC, location AMC Experimental Immunology-Hematology department. This project will utilize Saezlab's method COSMOS for regulatory network generation through the integration of multi-omic data. In this research, we applied the COSMOS method to gene expression and metabolomics datasets of CLL and healthy donor T cells.
